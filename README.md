# CODSOFT-Task1
# CODSOFT this project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on factors like age, gender, ticket class, and fare. It involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model building using machine learning algorithms to predict survival. A great beginner-friendly project in data science!
